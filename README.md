Flutter tts demo App 

🚀 Exciting Project Launch! 🚀

I’m thrilled to share my latest Flutter app development project, where I integrated the power of text-to-speech using the flutter_tts package! 🗣️🎤

This app is designed for educational purposes, featuring the A-Z alphabets paired with fun and engaging images. Here's how it works:

✅ Tap on an image, and the app will speak the name of the object out loud.
For example:
🍎 Tap on the Apple image, and it says "Apple."
🐶 Tap on the Dog image, and it says "Dog."

🔧 I utilized flutter_tts version 4.0.2 to bring this interactive learning experience to life.

This project combines the joy of learning with the convenience of text-to-speech technology. It's a great tool for kids, language learners, or anyone who loves visual learning.

Looking forward to sharing more details on the development process and how I’ve incorporated Flutter’s powerful capabilities. Stay tuned! 🎉
